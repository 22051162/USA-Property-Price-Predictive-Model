# USA-Property-Price-Predictive-Model

# Overview
This repository contains the files and code for a Predictive Analytics project that estimates property prices in the USA. Using real estate data, the project explores factors influencing property prices and implements predictive models, including regression and decision tree models, to estimate property sale prices.

# Files
22051162_BUS5PA_Assignment_1.Rmd: This RMarkdown file contains the complete analysis, including data exploration, cleaning, and predictive modeling.

22051162_BUS5PA Assignment 1.pdf: This PDF document provides a detailed assignment report, discussing the problem formulation, data cleaning, and the development of predictive models.

# Project Structure
Problem Formulation:
Defines the key factors affecting property prices in the USA.
Discusses various data sources and outlines the predictive modeling approach.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Identifies key variables and categorizes them into continuous, ordinal, and nominal variables.
Handles missing values and outliers, and performs correlation analysis to reduce dimensionality.

Predictive Modeling:
Implements multiple regression and decision tree models.
Compares the performance of different models based on RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
Stepwise regression is identified as the best-performing model for predicting sale prices.

# Key Features
Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Handles missing values, outliers, and transformations for categorical variables.

Predictive Models:
Includes regression and decision tree models.
Stepwise regression is the optimal model based on performance metrics.

Comparison of Models:
The project compares various models to determine the most accurate one for predicting property prices.

# How to Run
To reproduce the analysis:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/22051162/USA-Property-Price-Predictive-Model.git
Open the RMarkdown file 22051162_BUS5PA_Assignment_1.Rmd in RStudio.
Run the chunks step by step to reproduce the data cleaning and model development process.
Review the detailed findings in the provided PDF report.

# Results
The project finds that key variables such as LivingArea, OverallQuality, and GarageCars are strong predictors of property sale prices.
Stepwise regression provides the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE, making it the recommended model for estimating property prices in this dataset.
